    Introduction: Hello,  World Below
    The World Above
        // First example in Programming 101:
        class Main {
            function void main() {
                do Output.printString("Hello World");
                do Output.println();
                return;
            }
        }

    Abstrations
        It turns out that this strategy works well thanks to a special gift unique to humans:
    our ability to create and use abstractions. The notioin of abstraction, central to
    many arts and sciences, is normally taken to be a mental expression that seeks to
    sepearte in thought, and capture in some concise manner, the essence of some entity.
