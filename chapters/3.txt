3 Sequential Logic

Data-Flip-Flop

    Chip name:  DFF
    Inputs:     in
    Outputs:    out
    Function:   out(t) = in(t-1)
    Comment:    This clocked gate has a built-in implementation and thus
                there is no need to implement it.
    Hardware implementtations achieve this time dependency by simultaneously 
feeding the master clock signal to all the DFF gates in the platform. Hardware simulators
emulate the same effect in software.

Registes

    Chip name:  Bit
    Inputs:     in, load
    Outputs:    out
    Function:   if load(t-1) then out(t)=in(t-1) else out(t)=out(t-1)

    Chip name:  Register
    Inputs:     in[16], load
    Outputs:    out[16]
    Function:   if load(t-1) then out(t)=in(t-1) else out(t)=out(t-1)
    comments:   "=" is a 16-bit operation

Memory
    
    Chip name:  RANn    // n and k are listed below
    Inputs:     in[16], address[k], load
    Outputs:    out[16]
    Function    out(t)=RAM[address[t]](t)
                if load(t-1) then RAM[address(t-1)](t) = in(t-1)
    
    The specific RAM chips needed for the Hack platform are:
    Chip name       n       k
    RAM8            8       3
    RAM64           64      6
    RAM512          512     9
    RAM4K           4096    12
    RAM16K          16384   14
        
    Read:   To read the contents of register number m, we put m in the address input.
    The RAM's direct-access logic will select register number m, which will then emit
    its output value to the RAM's output pin. This is a combinational operation, independent of the clock.
    
    Write:  To write a new data d into register number m, we put m in the address input,
    d in the in input, adn assert the load input bit. This causes the RAM's direct-access logic
    to select register number m, and the load bit to enable it. In the next clock cycle, the
    selected register will commit to the value(d), and the RAM's output will start emitting it.


Counter
    Chip name:  PC
    Inputs:     in[16], inc, load, reset
    Outputs:    out[16]
    Function:   if reset(t-1) then out(t)=0
                else if load(t-1) then out(t)=in(t-1)
                else if inc(t-1) then out(t)=out(t-1)+1
                else out(t)=out(t-1)
    
n-Register Memory

    select a particular register from the RAM64 memory we use a 6-bit address, say xxxyyy.
The MSB xxx bits select one of the RAM8 chips,
The LSB yyy bits select one of the registers whithin the selectd RAM8.
